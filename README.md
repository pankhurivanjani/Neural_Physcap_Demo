 # Demo: "Neural PhysCap" Neural Monocular 3D Human Motion Capture with Physical Awareness
The implementation is based on **Neural Monocular 3D Human Motion Capture with Physical Awareness**   
[SIGGRAPH '21](http://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/PhysAware/).   
   
Authors: Soshi Shimada  Vladislav Golyanik  Weipeng Xu  Patrick PÃ©rez and Christian Theobalt  
 
## Dependencies
- Python 3.7
- Ubuntu 18.04 (The system should run on other Ubuntu versions and Windows, however not tested.)
- RBDL: Rigid Body Dynamics Library (https://rbdl.github.io/). Tested on  V.2.6.0.  (Important: set "RBDL_BUILD_ADDON_URDFREADER " to be "ON" when you compile. Also don't forget to add the compiled rbdl library in your python path use it.)

For RBDL Compilation:

	cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D RBDL_BUILD_ADDON_URDFREADER=ON -D RBDL_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER=ON ../
	make -j8
	sudo make install not working properly here.. https://github.com/rbdl/rbdl/issues/29

- pytorch 1.10.1
- For other python packages, please check requirements.txt

## Installation
- Download and install Python binded RBDL from  https://github.com/rbdl/rbdl
- Install Pytorch 1.8.1 with GPU support (https://pytorch.org/) (other versions should also work but not tested)
- Install python packages by:

		pip install -r requirements.txt

## How to Run 
1) Download pretrained model from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ViIDOiCkBcUUm_BIS3W1z2ELRTKYIbBQ/view?usp=sharing). Below, we assume all the pretrained networks are place under "../pretrained_neuralPhys/".
 
2) We provide a sample data under "sample_data" To run the code on our sample data, first go to root directory (neuralphyscap_demo_release) and run:
		
		export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/vanjani/rbdl/build/python

		python demo.py  --input_path sample_data/sample_dance.npy --net_path ../pretrained_neuralPhys/  --img_width 1280 --img_height 720

The predictions will be saved under "./results/"

3) To visualize the predictions, run:

		python Visualizations/simple.py 

## How to Run on Your Data
1. Run [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) and save the prediction.

Working resource for openpose on ubuntu 18.04

https://tyseng.medium.com/openpose-python-in-ubuntu-18-04-installation-guide-2021-5c09f4f2efe2

2. Process your openpose data to be compatible with NeuralPhyscap:
 
		python process_openpose.py --input_path /PATH/TO/OPENPOSE/JSON/FILE --save_path /PATH/TO/SAVE --save_file_name YOUR_DATA.npy

This will generate ".npy" input file to run NeuralPhyscap. Say we name the npy file "YOUR_DATA.npy". 

3. Run NeuralPhyscap on the generated npy file:
	 
		python demo.py  --input_path PATH/TO/YOUR_DATA.npy --net_path ../pretrained_neuralPhys/  --img_width IMAGE_WIDTH --img_height IMAGE_HEIGHT

 Replace IMAGE_WIDTH and IMAGE_HEIGHT with your own video width and height (integer values)
